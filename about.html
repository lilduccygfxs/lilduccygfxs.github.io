            <p><center>Hey, I'm Little Duck, a guy who makes GFXs. It'd mean a lot to me if you bought one of them. Here's some information about their pricing and more!</center></p>





            <p> <br><center>Information:</center><br>25 Robux set: This premium package offers exceptional customizability, engaging animations, and personalized text. <br>
                10 Robux set: This package includes customized text and offers good flexibility for personalization. <br>
                5 Robux set: A budget-friendly option providing good customizability without animations or custom text.
                <br> <br>
                Please note that all prices are after Roblox tax, due to this, please expect the prices to be slightly higher, as Roblox tax takes away 30% of my Robux income on gamepasses.
                <br> <br>
                Regarding animations, they can include effects such as glitch, shakes, and waviness, but do not involve the movement of your avatar.
                <br> <br>
                Upon completion of the GFX, a blurred or censored version will be provided for your review. Once you're satisfied, payment in Robux is required before receiving the finalized GFX. Additionally, I can provide evidence of completed orders from other customers to assure you that this is a legitimate service.
